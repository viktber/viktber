# Multi-Component C++ System

This project is a collection of modular C++ components demonstrating advanced class design, memory management, multithreading, and system simulation.

## Projects

### 1. LRUCache
An in-memory Least Recently Used (LRU) Cache using doubly-linked list and hash map for O(1) access and update time.

### 2. LRUCacheSet
An extension of LRUCache supporting segmented caching (e.g. per-CPU or per-key-range LRU behavior).

### 3. Airline Company System
A simulation of an airline's operational backend with support for managing flights, passengers, tickets, and reservations.

### 4. Trading System
A real-time trading system simulation involving exchanges, order matching, adapters, processors, and routing.


## Goals

- Design reusable and testable C++ classes.
- Practice memory and resource management.
- Implement multithreaded data pipelines with thread-safe queues.
- Simulate real-world systems like a trading engine and airline reservation.
